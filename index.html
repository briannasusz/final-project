    <p>What is it?<br>The use of electronic communicatuion to taunt and insult a person.<br>Typically over social media, these messages are usually intimidating or threatening.</p>
    <p>How to identify it?<br>Usually the child or person being cyberbullied will be too ashamed to tell someone they are being bullied.<br>That's why if an allogation is made an investigation must be done to collect all evidence.</p>
    <p>How to prevent it?<br>Restrict access on social media, or monitor your childs activity on social media.<br>Also, prolongning pr preventing your childs access to technology.<br>Such as computers or cellular devices will make cyberbullying impossible towards your child, or prevent hem from bullying other kids.</p>
